                <p>
                  In 2019, our founders were auditing construction sites when they found helmets that
                  collapsed under thumb pressure and &quot;3M&quot; respirators with no traceable batch numbers.
                  The audit report — and the supplier — is what SafetyPro was built to fix.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We started with a warehouse in Industrial Area and a simple promise:{" "}
                  <strong className="text-navy-900">
                    every product we sell is genuine, certified and quality-inspected
                  </strong>
                  . That promise now covers 15 categories, 40+ brands and thousands of products in stock.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, our corporate division manages framework supply for hospitals, county
                  governments and national contractors — delivering not just equipment, but the
                  documentation, pricing and accountability that procurement teams demand.
